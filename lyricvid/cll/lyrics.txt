You got me down on my knees
You got me climbing the trees
Bangin' the drum
For cute little lesbians	
Some guys are so scared they run
Ohhh ohhh
But to me
It's not worth it to mention
Ohh, Ohh
She's smilin' like Elvis
When she sees that hot little girl go by
Waggin' her pelvis
Just like a guy	
These girls just wanna' have fun,
But I think I'm fallin' in love,
They drive me wild	
Cute Little Lesbians
Cute Little Lesbians	
Most girls just don't have the stuff
Ohhh ohhh
To play the part of the femme-fe-tough
She wonders sometimes
What it is like
To have what I have
And have it all night
To flash it, and wield it
Admire it and feel it and
Plunge it like a knife	
And if she wants to include
A friend, well, I won't refuse
But I love only one
Cute Little Lesbian	
Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians
Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians	
I'll never ask of you to change your ways
You know I'll love you â€˜til the end of days
I'll be right here
when others run, run, run
Count on me to always
Come, come, come, come	
So, why don't you throw
Ohh, ohh
A little look my way
You might even like it
What's gettin' in our way
Cuz I know you girl
I know how you think
That man's at his best
When he's fixing your sink
But who better to covet your gender and love it
and protect you while you sleep	
You've got me down on my knees
You got me climbin' the trees
Bangin' the drum
For Cute Little Lesbians	
Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians
Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians	
Just me and you and your little girlfriend
Me and you and your little girlfriend
Me and you and your little girlfriend too
