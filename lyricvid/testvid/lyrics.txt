And I'm thinking
About this caged-in life
Can't help feeling
Life has passed me by
I just don't understand
The point of it all sometimes
Or the mouse in the trap
That struggles before it dies
So I'm calling
Up my boys tonight
Night is falling
So just one more time
I said Hey
Gonna play tonight
Have a round, drink it down
And the next one's mine
Let's go out with a blast
And let's do it right
One more time
Livin' Life
Too much drinking
I hear nature's call
Counting cracks in
This grimy bathroom wall
Seeing double
Don't think I should drive
I should stop now
While I can still count to five
But it's Hey, Hey, Hey
Life's okay tonight
While we're here commandeer
All the hootch in sight
Let's go out with a blast
And let's do it right
One more time
Livin' Life
We're not as young as we used to be
But we're taking this chance
We're gonna make us some history
While there's still time to dance
D d d d d d dance!
I said Hey, Hey, Hey
And we play tonight
Coke and Crown, all around
But the bottom line
Is we're out with a blast
So let's do it right
One more time
Livin' Life
I said Hey tonight
Singing cheers while we're here
For just one more time
Let's go out with a blast
And let's do it right
One more time
Livin' Life
